- Check the positive compatibility page to see if any third-party plug-ins will break due to this refactoring.
- Get rid of all the == checks between custom item values (and between other model values) since they don't have an
identity.

Editor object model:
ItemSet:
 - Keep the bypassChecks() option? (control shift) Perhaps allow it only in some cases?
 - Keep the functions that generate the default model for each type of custom item
 - Keep the resourcepack generation functions (but refactor to another class)
 - Keep the checks for the supported MC version of all objects upon exporting
 - Keep the functions that create the additional files like .zip and .txt
 - Keep the automatic back-up system
